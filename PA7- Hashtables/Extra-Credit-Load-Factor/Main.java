    Description: â€“ Create a program to collect some data about chain hashing that you worked on in exercise 2. You would be able to enter the name of input data file and a load factor. Each input data file will have N records and the first value in the file will tell you how many records are in the file. You would need to use N and the load factor to determine the initial size of the hash table. The first value of each record will be the key (county/state code as integer type) and remaining items on each record will be the value (population and county/state and you can treat it as one string). After all the entries are inserted to the table, print the table size, average number of probes, and  maximum number of probes for the worst case. It would take at least one probe for each insertion (checking initial location). Therefore, it would be two probes if second location is examined.

After confirming that your implementation works reasonably well against the small input file (popSmall.txt), run it against the larger input file (popLarge.txt) and collect some required data. You must try the load factors of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 against the large input file (3 different runs). Make sure that your hash table size is determined correctly according to the load factor by using the following formula: N / LF + 1. For example, if
a file has 5 values and for a test at load factor 0.5, the table size is 11 (5 / 0.5 + 1).
